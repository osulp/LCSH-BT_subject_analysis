# LCSH Broader Terms Subject Analysis

This repository contains several XSL stylesheets run in sequence against a local copy of the Library of Congress Subject Headings, in SKOS RDF format. The pipeline constructs a model of progressively broader subject headings for a given collection of library materials based on the LC subject terms found in the collection's metadata records (e.g. MARC catalog records, EAD finding aids, Dublin Core records, etc.). The repository includes tools to analyze the resulting model. 

## Background and development

This method was developed to create a baseline topic model for a research article _Text analysis of archival finding aids_, which is pending publication in _Information Technology and Libraries_ as of August 2024. The final topic model produced for that project using this method is contained in the supplementary OSF repository:

## Usage

_Examples are derived from Oregon State University's Special Collections and Archives Research Center's public collection of finding aids, from the project mentioned above._


## Planned improvements

Future work is planned to simplify and streamline this process.
